# Evaluate Task: {{TITLE}}

## Task ID
{{TASK_ID}}

## Success Criteria
{{SUCCESS_CRITERIA}}

## Instructions
1. Review the git diff summary to see what files the worker changed.
2. Read the modified files to understand the full context of the changes.
3. **Verify interfaces match** (CRITICAL):
   - JS `getElementById('x')` calls must have matching `id="x"` in HTML
   - JS `querySelector('.x')` calls must have matching `class="x"` in HTML/CSS
   - CSS class selectors must match classes used in HTML
   - API field names must be consistent (e.g., snake_case everywhere)
4. **Check for basic functionality**:
   - JS files should have no syntax errors
   - If success criteria specify exact IDs/classes, verify they are used correctly
5. Check each success criterion against the actual implementation.
6. Identify any boundary violations or unintended changes.
7. Provide your verdict as JSON.

Use `git diff --stat HEAD~1` to see a summary of files changed (avoids massive output for large changes).
Use `git diff HEAD~1 -- <filepath>` to see full diff for specific files only.
Use `Read` to examine specific files in detail.

**Common issues to catch:**
- HTML has `class="close-btn"` but CSS styles `.close-button` (MISMATCH)
- JS calls `getElementById('taskForm')` but HTML has `id="task-form"` (MISMATCH)
- Backend returns `user_id` but frontend accesses `data.userId` (MISMATCH)
