# Goal

{{GOAL}}

# Instructions

1. Explore the codebase to understand its structure, patterns, and conventions.
2. Analyze the goal and determine what changes are needed.
3. Decompose the goal into independent, parallelizable tasks.
4. For each task, identify the MINIMUM set of input files needed.
5. Define clear boundaries so workers stay focused.
6. Output your plan as a JSON object matching the required schema.

Remember:
- Workers are isolated. They cannot see each other's work or the broader project context.
- Workers operate in their own git worktree (a full copy of the repo at the current commit).
- Each worker only knows about its specific task. Do not reference other tasks in descriptions.
- Prefer more, smaller tasks over fewer, larger ones (within reason).
- If tasks must happen in sequence, use the "depends_on" field.
